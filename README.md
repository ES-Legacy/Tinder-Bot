# Tinder-Bot
This is designed to be a bot that automates my Tinder experience.

## Features
- Automate account login ✅
- Automate liking everybody ✅
- Automate sending first message upon match ✅ 
- Automate sending notification through either phone or email if somebody sends me a message ❌

## Tech Stack Used
- Python
- Selenium

## Things That Need to Be Done Still
- Further testing on fluidity of switching between likes and matches (I think this was fixed, however hasn't been actually tested yet)
- Automate phone or email notifications upon recieving a message (if this is something that can be implemented with my bot's approach)
- Improve quality by refactoring code to not use sleep, and use an alternate faster and more consistent approach
- Handling ads, running out of likes, and revealing a liker
- Ad file with multiple pickup lines so it randomly selects a pickup line
